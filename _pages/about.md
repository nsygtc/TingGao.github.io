Hi, this is Ting Gao from China. I'm a research assistant at the School of Engineering, Westlake University in China, supervised by Prof. [Yaochu Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=B5WAkz4AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW). I'm currently pursuing a Ph.D. in AI Agents, Reinforcement Learning, and Optimization. If you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my work, feel free to reach out! :)

My research interests include AI agents, Reinforcement Learning, and Optimization.

Here is my [resume](../assets/Resume_TingGao.pdf), and you can find more information about me on it.

Education Background
------
I recently completed my Master's degree in Computer Technology at the **Beijing Institute of Technology**, where I achieved a GPA of 3.68/4.00 and was recognized with a high IELTS score of 7. During my master's program, I had the privilege of visiting The **University of British Columbia (UBC)**, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. [Jasmin Jelovica](https://mech.ubc.ca/jasmin-jelovica/), focusing on **Multi-Agent Search in Optimization**.

My academic journey began at **Harbin Engineering University**, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology with a GPA of 3.63/4.00, ranking 6th out of 273 students (top 2.2%). This strong foundation has propelled me into various research endeavors and publications.

Research and Publications
------
My research interests revolve around AI Agents, Reinforcement Learning, and Optimization. 

I have several publications to my name, including an invited paper on reliability and security in swarm robots and AI agents, and a paper on a **Bit-Oriented Distance-based Intelligent Optimizer (BODI Optimizer)** for key recovery, which achieves significant reductions in power traces compared to state-of-the-art methods and is currently under review for USENIX Security'25. I've also contributed to research on zero-shot robotic manipulation and a review on security and privacy in swarm intelligence systems. At UBC, I applied reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the OSY problem and explored the efficiency of the multi-agent DDPG algorithm.

The website is still under construction...

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
